In this Website I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. It is a responsive website for mobile and Laptop or any other devices.

Procees For Designing the website -->
Firstily I created header section for the website. I put name , search box and some icons from font awesome like heart, 
shopping cart, and all the related links for showing the fonts within the website.


In header-2 class I created Nav-bar like home,featured, reviews and contactus page links for contactus page. And If 
I open the website in Mobile so there was other Bottom Nav-bar for mobile view. then I created different different 
Sections Related to Nav-Bar Like home section Featured Section and Review Section using different - different images 
and classes and using Some css Functionalities for responsiveness of the webstie in different views.


After that I create a contacus Page for any type of Inquire or Demo requests. here I created a Form Which a user can 
send any type of Query related to the Website to the admin. I am not adding the function in the filled form information
is sent by mail because function has to be a correct email and password then the query sent to admin.



I used Different Different Functionalites of CSS For the responsiveness of Website like using REM unit for responsiveness that become mobile Freindly.
